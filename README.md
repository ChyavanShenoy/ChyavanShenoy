👋 Hey there! I'm a coding wizard 🧙‍♂️, lifelong learner 🌱, and a tech enthusiast with a penchant for innovation.

🚀 My mission? To build apps that don't just work, but wow! 🤩 Experienced in Python 🐍, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React ⚛️, C/C++, and now adding Go 🏃‍♂️, React Native 📱, FastAPI 🚗, Mobile App Development 📲, Cloud Native Apps ☁️, Cloud Run, and GCP 🌐 to my arsenal.

📚 As a self-taught techie, I dive headfirst into new tech oceans 🌊. My latest adventure? The thrilling world of Cybersecurity 🕵️‍♂️! I'm hacking my way through HTB, THM, and Vulnhub, all while eyeing that shiny C|EH Certification in Cybersecurity 🛡️.

💬 When I'm not coding, you'll catch me in tech forums, tinkering with gadgets 🛠️, or deep in a tech magazine 📖. I'm all ears 👂 for a chat with fellow code enthusiasts, especially if it’s about the next big thing in tech.

🤓 And oh, I'm a pun aficionado 🎤 - expect a pun-derful time in our code reviews and a barrage of dad jokes. They say laughter is the best medicine, and I prescribe it in heavy doses! 😂

Let's join forces and turn our ideas into digital magic ✨!
